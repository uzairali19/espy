# Capstone Project (HTML, CSS & JS)

> The project is a capstone project of week 4 of Microverse. We have to assume that a UI is given to us and replicate that just by looking at it. This is done in all 3 screen sizes using media queries and bootstrap classes. The use of Flexbox and Grid would also be shown on the website for evaluating purposes.
